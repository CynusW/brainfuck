# Brainfuck

## How does it work?
In this Brainfuck interpreter, you have 3 options:

1. `brainfuck --shell`
   - Sets the application to shell mode.
   - To exit the shell, type `exit` and press enter.
2. `brainfuck -f <file>`
   - Executes BF code in a file.
3. `brainfuck <code>`
   - Executes a one-line BF code.

Note: The memory is dynamically allocated.
